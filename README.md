# Dictionary-java
This repository contains a Python-flavored implementation of a Dictionary class in simple Java.

All Java is restricted to the AP Computer Science A Subset in order to be accessible at the high
school level.

I use the phrase "Python-flavored" because some features will necessarily be different in substance,
due to Java's lack of operator overloading.
